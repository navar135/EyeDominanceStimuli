Here is the experiment to test remotely how eye dominance changes as a function of constant perceptual learning

Participants are asked to complete 12 45min sessions 

The main experiment presents two drifting eyes filtered to each eye by anaglyph glasses.
The aspect ratio of the concentric circle grating is manipulated and the participant is displayed a cue to respond when the ratio change occurs 

This project is not frequently maintained since it is hosted on gitlab and sporadically updated here

Eye dominance is the tendency for information from one eye to be weighted more heavily in determining a visual experience. Observers can exhibit consistent levels of eye dominance, meaning that one eye determines most experiences. Extreme cases lead to amblyopia, a visual disorder. Patients have poor vision in one eye, causing the brain to disregard information from that eye. Frequent training on visual tasks, known as perceptual learning (PL), is a promising therapy for amblyopia, however, its effects in the brain remain unknown. Using functional MRI we will investigate how PL strengthens eye-specific responses in the brain.
