Here is the experiment to test remotely how eye dominance changes as a function of constant perceptual learning

Participants are asked to complete 12 45min sessions 

The main experiment presents two drifting eyes filtered to each eye by anaglyph glasses.
The aspect ratio of the concentric circle grating is manipulated and the participant is displayed a cue to respond when the ratio change occurs
