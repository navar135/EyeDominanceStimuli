## Project Objective
- Eye dominance is the tendency for information from one eye to be weighted more heavily in determining a visual experience. Observers can exhibit consistent levels of eye dominance, meaning that one eye determines most experiences. Extreme cases lead to amblyopia, a visual disorder. Patients have poor vision in one eye, causing the brain to disregard information from that eye. Frequent training on visual tasks, known as perceptual learning, is a promising therapy for amblyopia, however, its effects in the brain remain unknown. We will investigate how perceptual learning strengthens eye-specific responses in the brain.
